Motion Project
==============

This project contains the code for the research program that I participate from Aug/2014 until Aug/2015, it is about motion capture and data analysis. I wrote different pieces of code in Python, C++ and R to try to solve my problem, which is basic a try to look into a horse movement using retrorreflexives markers or not. Not using a marker shown to be a really difficult job since we are not using professional equipment to develop our research. Then finally we ended up using Kinovea as a first shot since this is the first year os this research involving veterinary and computer science and engineering techniques.
